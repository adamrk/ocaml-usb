* What it is ?

OCaml-USB is a binding to libusb-1.0. It uses Lwt to make it easy to
use asynchronous IO features of libusb-1.0.

* Requirement

OCaml-USB needs ocaml >= 3.11, lwt >= 2.0.0 and libusb-1.0.

* Building and installation

To build and install it just type:

  $ make all
  $ make install

This will install the "usb" package (ocamlfind is required).

* Development

The last development version of ocaml-usb can always be found in the
darcs repository hosted at darcs.ocamlcore.org:

  $ darcs get http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/repos/ocaml-usb/ocaml-usb

local variables:
mode: outline
